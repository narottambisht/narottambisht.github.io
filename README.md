This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question
is usually **yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I
find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and
designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your
own.

Please also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
